# SOMA

![SOMA Logo](images/research/soma_logo.svg)

SOMA is an implementation of the SCMF algorithm for soft, polymeric materials. It is fully implemented in C with OpenACC pragmas for multi-GPU acceleration on modern high-performance supercomputers such as the JUWELS Booster, SUMMIT, or ThetaGPU. I am the lead developer for this project and enforce strict software engineering principles, join us with the development. SOMA has been selected by SPEC to be part of their recent HPC benchmark to quantify new machines with real world applications.

## Software Engineering Challenges

From the perspective of software engineering SOMA poses several challenges and in 2016/2017 when we first started working on SOMA we made some design decisions that I would like to discuss a little bit here.

For a research project performance is of the highest importance.
